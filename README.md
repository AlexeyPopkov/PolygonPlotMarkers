# PolygonPlotMarkers
Polygon-based plot markers for Wolfram Mathematica

The package contains a rich set of carefully implemented shapes designed for flexible creation of publication-quality illustrations, as well as the functionality to create new markers. It is integrated into the Wolfram Language (version 12 or higher) as ResourceFunction["PolygonMarker"] and available in the Wolfram Function Repository at https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/PolygonMarker/.

This repository keeps the original author's version of the package which contains all the general-purpose functions used to generate the shapes. This version is fully compatible with Wolfram Mathematica version 8 or higher. Originally published at http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/85094/280, where description of the package and usage examples can be found.
